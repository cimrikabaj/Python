#DAY 3

#1.
# a=input("enter first number:")
# b=input("Enter second number:")
# #a and b are in the form of string so concatinate huncha so inoder to find the sum we need to use int to typecast it
# sum=int(a) + int(b)
# print(sum)

#2.take two number as user input and print the greatest
# a=int(input("enter first number:"))
# b=int(input("Enter second number:"))
# if a>b:
#     print("a is greatest")
# else:
#     print("b is greatest")

#3.take three number as user input and print the lowest
# a=int(input("enter first number:"))
# b=int(input("Enter second number:"))
# c=int(input("Enter third number:"))
# if a<=b and a<=c:#c>=a<=b
#     print(a,"a is lowest")
# elif b<=a and b<=c:#c>=b<=a
#     print(b,"b is lowest")
# else:
#     print(c,"c is lowest")

#4.take user input as a number and print either its odd or even
# a=int(input("enter a number:"))
# b=a % 2
# if b==0:
#     print("it is even")
# else:
#     print("it is odd")

#5.take user input as number and print either its exactly divisible by 3,5 or 7
# a=int(input("enter a number:"))
# if a%3==0 :
#     print("it is divisible by 3")
# if a%5==0:
#     print("it is divisible by 5")
